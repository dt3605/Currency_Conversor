# Currency Converter GUI

#### Video Demo: [https://youtu.be/fk3c3_McMcA](https://youtu.be/fk3c3_McMcA)

#### Description:
The Currency Converter GUI is a Python application built using Tkinter that allows users to convert between USD, BRL, EUR, and GBP. The application fetches live exchange rates from an online API and provides a user-friendly graphical interface with country flag emojis to enhance the user experience.

#### Files:
- `currency_converter_gui.py`: The main Python program that runs the GUI, handles user input, fetches live exchange rates, and performs conversions.
- `README.md`: This file, containing a detailed description of the project and its functionality.

#### Functionality:
The application allows the user to:
1. Enter an amount to convert.
2. Select the source and target currencies.
3. Click the 'Convert' button to see the converted value instantly.
4. View live exchange rates for the selected currency in a clear and visually appealing format.

#### Design Decisions:
- **Live API integration:** We used `exchangerate.host` to fetch real-time rates.
- **Fallback rates:** In case the API fails, predefined rates ensure the application still works.
- **Tkinter GUI:** Chosen for simplicity and ease of deployment.
- **Visuals:** Country flag emojis were added to make the interface more engaging and to help users quickly identify currencies.

#### Challenges:
Implementing API requests, handling network errors, and updating the GUI dynamically were key challenges. The project also focused on creating an intuitive interface for users unfamiliar with programming.

#### Future Improvements:
- Add more currencies.
- Improve the design with icons and better layout.
- Include a conversion history log.
- Optionally, add a dark mode for better user experience.

#### Conclusion:
This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, GUI design with Tkinter, and API integration. It combines functionality, aesthetics, and user experience into a single application suitable for everyday currency conversion.
