📝 About this Project

This is my final project for the CS50 course, fully developed by Davi Teodoro. It is a Currency Converter GUI that allows users to convert between USD, BRL, EUR, and GBP quickly and safely.
The project combines Python programming, Tkinter for the graphical interface, API integration for real-time exchange rates, and error handling to ensure a smooth experience. It is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, making it easy for anyone to use, regardless of technical experience.

🛠️ Features

Convert values between USD, BRL, EUR, and GBP
Real-time exchange rates via API
Offline conversion using fallback rates if no internet is available
Input validation to prevent errors
Clean, user-friendly interface with flags for each currency for quick recognition
Results displayed with two decimal places for clarity

📂 Project Files

currency_converter_gui.py – Main GUI script; handles user input, API requests, and displays conversion results.
converser.py – Core logic for currency conversion.

🎨 Design Decisions

Tkinter was chosen for simplicity, cross-platform compatibility, and ease of creating responsive interfaces.
API integration ensures accurate, up-to-date rates, while fallback rates maintain usability offline.
Flags as visual indicators improve clarity and help users quickly identify currencies.
Layout and design focus on simplicity, with clearly labeled inputs, menus, and a central conversion button for ease of use.

⚠️ Challenges

Fetching and updating API rates dynamically without slowing the interface
Handling network errors and invalid inputs gracefully
Balancing a clean visual design with functional clarity

🚀 Future Improvements

Add more currencies for global versatility
Implement a dark mode or custom themes
Keep a history of past conversions for user reference
Optimize API calls for faster performance and multiple requests
Add dynamic updates for fallback rates to always stay accurate
